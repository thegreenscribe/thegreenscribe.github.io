      <p class="hero__body about">Hansi has been a GreenScribe for over twenty years, meeting clients through trusted associates and freelancing while pursuing a multitude of diverse interests. During this time she created content, mostly as a ghostwriter. The pandemic served as the ideal time to launch her passion project The GreenScribe, LLC with her longtime twin flame, Kristin Kennedy. These two marvelous writers/editors are the perfect team-quick-witted, and moved by the same spirit of adventure, they are over the moon to be working together!  Great things are bubbling in the brain cauldron Kristin and Hansi share as literary witches. Read more about their backgrounds and many talents in their About sections, below.</p>

        <p class="about__text">I wear many hats, my favorite of which is the GreenScribe<em> pileus</em> (latin: <em>hat</em>, also: <em>freedom</em>) adorned with a vibrant fan of feathers. My most prized, glorious feather is a flowing ease born of expertise-I play with words at work, for fun, for therapy, for connection with the world, and most importantly, for magic.  Whether it’s backpacking in the wilderness or shopping for quill pens and ink pots -- wherever you see me, I am creating energetic brilliance in written linguistic form. A significant portion of my gray matter is an old-timey typewriter, always clacking, clicking, and ringing new stories into existence.<br>In the distant past, before the Age of Aquarius, I was quite professionally diversified while attending school (everything from bartender to landscaper). The glorious result is that I am now the proud owner of an <strong><em>English Literature and Composition Bachelor of Arts</em></strong>, and some seriously stacked triceps.</p>

        <h1 class="about__title lower"><strong class="bold-text">How it Started</strong><br></h1>
        <p class="about__text">Hansi read hungrily as a child-devouring thirty books a week, to the amazement of local librarians. She announced to her parents and teachers that she aspired to authorship at seven , and began writing: notebooks of inventions, short stories, ideas, dialogues, plays, poems, song lyrics, whole picture storybooks, and cartoon strips flowed forth in a river of ink.  She  has poured her writing skills into a number of professional pools, and has lost count of the many projects she consulted on as a reader, proofreader, a writer, and a writing muse, and collaborator.  After spending some time as a teacher for K-12  students (where she is affectionately known as “Ms.T”), she taught many students to improve their writing, reading, and vocabularies while tutoring language skills-and came away with her own idea for an immersive, engaging curriculum.</p><img src="images/IMG-5716-1.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Hansi Tomlinson" class="image-17">

      <div id="w-node-_61a0a3c8-3f79-a272-8a37-db14a7974028-05138274" class="about__content">
        <h1 class="about__title lower"><strong class="bold-text-2">How it&#x27;s Going</strong></h1>
        <p class="about__text">AIf Hansi isn’t writing or buried in a book, she’s sure to be  on backpacking trails with her fiancé, Matthew Perry of MJPerry.dev (who made this beautifully responsive website!) and their dog Maddie, out in the garden singing plants to life, researching travel for her new travel agent venture, or at the piano composing music. One of her proudest accomplishments is raising a fascinating person, her son Noah Hawk -- it was just the two of them in his young years, and they had a good time making blanket forts and camping in real tents, too. As Hansi mentioned in The Story of The GreenScribe, she is now officially in business with her bestie, Kristin Kennedy-thus begins the stuff of myth and legend-Mars, Saturn and Uranus unite!<br></p>

        <h1 class="about__title lower"><strong>Professional Areas of Study and Research</strong><br></h1>
        <p class="about__text">Hansi’s inquisitive mind never ceases exploring, and she is currently taking classes for a certificate in <strong>cryptocurrency literacy</strong> which will evolve her interests in both <strong>technical writing,</strong> and <strong>decentralized economics</strong>. Her niche is a large one-the vast expanse of the English language!  She knows the rarely traversed corners of this linguistic universe with the familiarity of one who needs no map.  She doesn’t intend to stop at the borders of English either-Hansi is currently studying Spanish, French, Italian, Russian, Norwegian, and Sanskrit. Hansi’s other avenue of avid research continues to be<strong><em> the language of ecology in the everyday world</em></strong>-a linguistic green bridge of sorts, or as Hansi calls it, <em>The Green Lexicon</em> (a working title).  Graduate research courses, teaching courses, linguistics courses, many literature and composition courses, and years of taking the path less travelled have created this uniquely talented, full-stack language editor and content creator, eagerly awaiting the chance to render you happily astonished by the clarity elegance, and fun she imbues into  many creations.<br></p>

        <p id="w-node-_3562d4bf-7870-08cc-a22e-18cf360582bd-05138274" class="about__text">Kristin Kennedy graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Theater from California Polytechnic State University with a Playwriting emphasis and an English minor. Ms. Kennedy began writing as a child and won her first short story contest at the age of ten. Her first love was Edgar Allen Poe and the transcendentalists. She became a thorn in the side of her elementary school librarian whilst taunting her to bring in higher level plays for her to read after running through all the Shakespear they had to offer. As an adult she cut her teeth writing transcription for films and documentaries, as well as proofreading and writing synopses of novel manuscripts for the Kohner Agency literary department of Los Angeles. Following this, she spent the bulk of her career writing copy for the media company Shout! Factory including but not limited to packaging, publicity, marketing, product descriptions and internal/external newsletters. <br>Using these skills, she became a freelance social media manager working for the growing pool of startups and apps in San Francisco building networking strategies, writing engaging press releases, web content, newsletters, and social media blasts across all popular platforms (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc.) increasing audience engagement and product awareness. Having concurrently earned a CSI certificate and explored her interests in Forensic Chemistry as well as Administrative Justice she is a specialist in writing compelling legal and science-based copy. </p>
        <p id="w-node-_67683370-3512-9efa-51ff-402a6c61bbae-05138274" class="about__text">In her free time, Kristin performs spoken word poetry gathering inspiration from the still vibrant North Beach in San Francisco. She spends her days in gratitude soaking up the overcast and listening to the jazz like foghorns in the distance. There are never enough words to describe the joy she feels while writing, and being heard.</p>
